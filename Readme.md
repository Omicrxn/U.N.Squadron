## Description
U.N. Squadron was developed and published by Capcom on December 31, 1989. Initially it was developed for the arcade of the same company, the CPS arcade, but it was later launched for the Super NES and Sinclair ZX Spectrum on 1991. It was known in Japan as Area 88 since the game was based on the manga Area 88 created by Kaoru Shintani. It has a secuel game named Carrier Air Wing (U.S.Navy in Japan) which was released in 1990 for the CP system arcade.

While at the moment Capcom was developing vertically scrolling shooters, U.N.Squadron was a side-scrolling shooter with great graphics for the time. One of the main attributes that makes U.N.Squadron stand out from the rest of shooters is it's RPG elements with a lot of customization. You can buy new airplanes and equip them with the weapons you choose.
