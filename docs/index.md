# U.N. Squadron
This project is a tribute to U.N. Squadron (1989), developed and released by Capcom.

U.N. Squadron is an arcade shoot'em up single-player game (horizontal scrolling shooter game). Initially it was developed for the arcade of the same company, but two years later, in 1991, it was launched for the SNES (the version we are working on). This game was known in Japan as Area 88 since the game was based on the manga Area 88 created by Karou Shintani. It has a sequel game named Carrier Air Wing (U.S. Navy in Japan) which was released in 1990 for the CP system arcade.
