U.N Squadron is an arcade game released by Capcom in 1989. Initially it was developed for the arcade of the same company, but two years later, in 1991, it was launched
for the SNES (the version we are doing). This game was known in Japan as Area 88 since the game was based on the manga Area 88 created by Karou Shintani.
